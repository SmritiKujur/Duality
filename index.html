<h4>Impact and Timeliness:</h4><p>As a direct result of the city's negligence to repair its roads and furthermore its reluctance to look for a more concrete solution, the citizens have had to suffer from potholes. Sometimes, said potholes have been have a foot deep often causing dangerous motor accidents. Not just that, these potholes are a hazardous vortex of spewing microbes that cause various diseases in the monsoon. Regular protests and efforts from the citizens have also lagged thereby increasing the inconvenience. And all of this Is even before we talk on the impact we have had on the impeding infamous Bangalore traffic.
It's not all bad though as we have some incredible road infrastructure almost making Bangalore at times seem foreign. Such was the potential of our city that she had to be nerfed.

<h4>Prominence and Proximity:</h4><p>Being home to India's tech giants and countless multinational companies, Bangalore is one of the most prominent cities on the global stage. Having cutting-edge technology built up in the city meant that back in the 90s a flock of It professionals flooded the city. It was time for Bangalore to rise up to the occasion and catch up to the tech. Unfortunately the insane growth could not keep up in infrastructure and surely Bangalore suffered with a case of overpopulation.

<h4>Conflict:</h4>
<p>The raging battle has ensued and continuous to go on between citizens and the government. There are online portals being developed to raise awareness and complaints and actions are being taken. The fickle nature of the roads makes it difficult to even handle since theyre so volatile and sometimes get destroyed within months of being built.

<h4>Human Interest:</h4>
<p> Behind the chaos of Bangalore’s roads are countless human stories. Residents who have faced accidents due to potholes, commuters who spend hours stuck in traffic, and delivery workers struggling to meet deadlines are just a few examples of the toll the roads take on daily life. Citizens, in some cases, have taken matters into their own hands by planting saplings in potholes or filling them with bricks to draw attention to the issue. This struggle is not just about inconvenience but also about the safety and well-being of millions who traverse the city every day.

<h4>Conclusion: </h4><p>Bangalore’s roads reflect a troubling duality. While parts of the city boast modern expressways and high-tech hubs, much of it is mired in crumbling, dangerous streets. The crisis underscores the urgent need for better urban planning, proper road maintenance, and traffic management to restore the city’s reputation and improve the quality of life for its millions of residents. The story of Bangalore’s roads is one of a global city in conflict with itself—booming, but burdened by its own infrastructure.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
